# Gooner, The Discord Bot
My friends and I play daily games like Framed and Thrice with some regularity and share our scores on Discord. I've had some curiosity as to what our overall scores look like, so I wrote this bot to keep track of that for us. 

I'm relearning Python for my new job, so this was also an excuse to get some additional practice. I learned some things a long the way, which I'll share in this README.


### My Journey with Python

1. **Holy DI**. Since you can monkey patch in Python, DI seems to have evolved into a hot mess in the Python community (IMO), often favoring quick implementation over more maintainable designs. I tried my hand at actually passing dependencies into class constructors. Doing that manually was pretty annoying, and that led me to explore some DI packages that I'm hoping to use in future projects. 
2. **ORM + API + Business Logic domain? Oh, you mean a DB Model?** This is more applicable to my current job and the nature of Python development that seems prevalent, but it seems as though Peewee models (or Django models, at that) get treated as the domain model that drives communication between services. It's _also_ used as the DB api in various services, without leveraging an intermediary db api. On paper that seems fine, but in practice, that can lead to some pretty wild coupling between your database model (read: _how_ you save data) and your business domain (read: _what_ you are doing). Those don't need to be 1-to-1, and for the purpose of extending your application, be it changing how you store data, how you access data, and how your services talk to each other, it often makes sense to have the ORM, db api, and domain models be separate, even if that introduces some redundancy in what you write (hey, with Co-Pilot, that's hardly an excuse these days).
3. With all that said, I fell into some traps in this project. The first of which was passing db models (as the db api) as dependencies when they also act as a a reference to a db object. The second of which was not introducing a DI package sooner.
